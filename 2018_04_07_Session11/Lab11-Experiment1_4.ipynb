In addition to storing an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients vt like Adadelta and RMSprop, Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients mt, similar to momentum. Whereas momentum can be seen as a ball running down a slope, Adam behaves like a heavy ball with friction, which thus prefers flat minima in the error surface.We compute the decaying averages of past and past squared gradients mt and vt respectively as follows:\n","\n","![alt text](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/anoverviewofgradientdescentoptimizationalgorithms-170414055411/95/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms-64-638.jpg?cb=1492149859)\n","mt and vt are estimates of the first moment (the mean) and the second moment (the uncentered variance) of the gradients respectively, hence the name of the method. As mt and vt are initialized as vectors of 0's, the authors of Adam observe that they are biased towards zero, especially during the initial time steps, and especially when the decay rates are small (i.e. β1 and β2 are close to 1).\n","\n","\n","Default values of 0.9 for β1, 0.999 for β2, and 10−8 for ϵ.
