Almost all of that size is taken up with the weights for the neural connections, since there are often many millions of these in a single model. Because they're all slightly different floating point numbers, simple compression formats like zip don't compress them well.\n","\n","Training neural networks is done by applying many tiny nudges to the weights, and these small increments typically need floating point precision to work. Taking a pre-trained model and running inference is very different. If you think about recognizing an object in a photo you've just taken, the network has to ignore all the noise, lighting changes, and other non-essential differences between it and the training examples it's seen before, and focus on the important similarities instead. This ability means that they seem to treat low-precision calculations as just another source of noise, and still produce accurate results even with numerical formats that hold less information.\n","\n","Once again we do our regular imports.\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"3-XorEeL1akR","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","np.random.seed(1337)  #

network\n","\n","Here we see that 8 clusters are too less in order to maintain the network at the same accuracy since we see almost a 3% drop in performance. One of the solutions is to retrain the network. This helps the other weights to compensate for those weights which on being rounded off to the nearest cluster center have resulted in a drop in performance. Accuracy can be recovered significantly on retraining the network and then non-uniformly quantizing the weights again.\n","\n","#### Excercise"]},{"metadata":{"id":"wHZAWkR71alX","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# reset = False\n","# net = training(net, reset)\n","# perform non-uniform quantization\n","# test(net)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"YwVqPybs1alY","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"rNRWfCEY1alc","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### References\n","\n","1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6115.pdf"]},{"metadata":{"id":"EUiW-ksD1alc","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
